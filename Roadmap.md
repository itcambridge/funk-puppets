### Questions for Clarification:
1. Are the sound files synchronized or independent (i.e., can they play in harmony)?
2. Do you want animations (beyond GIFs) or other visual effects?
3. Should we include mobile responsiveness as part of the core roadmap?
4. What are the expected traffic levels for server configuration?
5. What is the required retention period for chat history?
6. Should we implement automatic chat backups?

Let me know if any additional steps or features should be included.
