### Questions for Clarification:
1. Are the sound files synchronized or independent (i.e., can they play in harmony)?
2. Do you want animations (beyond GIFs) or other visual effects?
3. Should we include mobile responsiveness as part of the core roadmap?
4. What are the expected traffic levels for server configuration?

Let me know if any additional steps or features should be included.
